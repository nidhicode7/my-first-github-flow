The GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow for code collaboration that emphasizes continuous delivery. Unlike the more complex Git Flow, it uses a simple, agile model centered on two types of branches. The main branch always contains production-ready, deployable code, while feature branches are created for every new feature or bug fix.
